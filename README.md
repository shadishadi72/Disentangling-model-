# Disentangling model of heartbeat dynamics

This computational model quantifies the contribution of multiple concurrent stimuli in modulating cardiovascular
dynamics. In this preliminary attempt, the model
estimates the high-frequency power of heartbeat dynamics,
and derives disentangling coefficients quantifying the effect of
multiple elicitations. Please refer to the following paper for more details:
